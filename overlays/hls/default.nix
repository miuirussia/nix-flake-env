    Haskell Language Server (HLS) is the latest attempt make an IDE-like
    experience for Haskell that's compatible with different editors. HLS
    implements Microsoft's Language Server Protocol (LSP). With this
    approach, a background service is launched for a project that answers
    questions needed by an editor for common IDE features.
    Note that you need a version of HLS compiled specifically for the GHC
    compiler used by your project.  If you have multiple versions of GHC and
    HLS installed in your path, then a provided wrapper can be used to
    select the right one for the version of GHC used by your project.
